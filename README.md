### Citizen services - Streamlining public service delivery with AI
 # Scenario: 
Priya, a mother of two from a rural village in Madhya Pradesh, receives a monthly allowance of INR10,000 and wants to explore 
various government schemes for her family's benefit. However, the information about eligibility and the process for availing 
these schemes is scattered, making it difficult for her to access the right services. She often faces challenges such as lengthy 
travel, long queues, and missing documents, which complicate her efforts to secure the support she needs.
 # Studentâ€™s challenge: 
Develop an AI-driven platform that streamlines access to government schemes and services for individuals like Priya and 
develop a curated experience. The solution could leverage AI for tasks such as verifying documents, automating the discovery of 
eligible schemes, and providing personalized guidance, making it easier for citizens to understand their eligibility and avail the 
benefits efficiently. You can refer to https://www.myscheme.gov.in/
